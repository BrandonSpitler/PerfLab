List of Code of Improvememts:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.) ~~Taking variable calculation outside of forloop ~~ 
On lines 105 and 106 of the original FilterMain.cpp (the two inner for loops that loop through the filter) 
there were the lines filter -> getSize() that got executed every single iteration of the loop. Instead of having
this value have to be recalculated every iteration, I moved its calculation outside of the for loop (its value
stays the same) to save a little bit of time. 

This was also done with input_width and the input_height variables

2.) ~~Reordered referencing of col, row, plane to match the way that matrices are stored in memory ~~
	We know that in C, matrices are stored in Row-Major order, meaning that all elements across a row 
are accessed before moving to the next row. Originally, the code in FilterMain was arranged such that the 
outer loop was going through the columns and the inner loop was going through the rows. This means that in 
memory the elements are stored the opposite of how they are accessed by the loop. Reversing this significantly 
improved performance. I also placed the plane loop on the very outside because the filter works by accessing each
row and each column on a single plane before moving on the next plane, therefore it would make sense that the plane
gets updated only when every row and column of that plane has been accessed
